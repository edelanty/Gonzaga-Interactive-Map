# Gonzaga Interactive Map
### What the Project Does
The Gonzaga Interactive Map is a mobile application designed to help Gonzaga University students navigate the campus more effectively. It provides an interactive map that includes key features like favorite locations, retrieving location information, and filtering spots of interest. Users can mark favorite spots, apply filters for specific location types (e.g., food, study areas, or classrooms), and enable notifications for selected favorites.

### Why the Project is Useful
This app enhances the campus experience by offering students a dynamic, student-driven map where they can explore, tag, and provide feedback on various campus locations. It can be especially helpful for newcomers or anyone looking to quickly discover popular spots for studying, eating, socializing, and all that campus has to offer.
